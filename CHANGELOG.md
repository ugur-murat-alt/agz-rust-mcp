# Changelog

_An AGZ Yazılım product._

All notable changes to `agz-rust-mcp` (formerly `agz-rust-coder`) are
documented here. The project uses Semantic Versioning and follows the Keep a
Changelog structure.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Four bundled Rust workflow, repair, refactor and performance skills, available
  offline through MCP prompts/resources and `skills list/show/export`.
- Exact workspace package and typed Cargo target selection for validation, plus
  a `build` target for compilation and linking without running tests.
- Execution-group and streaming test evidence for configuration-wide Cargo suites.

### Fixed

- Include required cache metadata in MCP catalogs so strict modern clients such
  as ZCode can discover the tools, prompts and resources.
- Require the npm launcher's automatic PATH candidate to match its package version;
  otherwise resolve the matching release instead of silently starting an older MCP.
- Document separate ZCode, OpenCode and OpenCode2 client configurations, explicit
  latest-version npm resolution and first-download startup allowances.
- Resolve authorized main checkouts, linked worktrees, package/source directories
  and inherited/shared path dependencies consistently across compiler and source tools.
- Refresh added/removed Cargo targets and reject stale combined verification;
  incomplete audits no longer claim clean source.
- Preserve Cargo feature unification and conditional target eligibility by running
  full configurations together. Separate mapped/impact/nextest passes cannot grant
  a full-suite result. Zero-test and opaque harness results remain inconclusive.
- Include enabled example/bench tests and doctests while keeping ordinary example
  compilation separate from executed-test counts.
- Stop unrelated check/test commands from superseding one another on unchanged source.
- Keep Windows target path identities stable across cold builds and final freshness
  checks, avoiding false stale results when Cargo first creates its output directory.

### Changed

- Share the configured quiet-input window for unchanged source within one MCP
  process without reusing completed validation evidence.
- Remove duplicate Cargo JSON from compact responses while preserving diagnostics,
  omissions and bounded human output; share benchmark transport helpers.
- Advance the pre-1.0 minor version for public Rust request/evidence fields and
  enum variants. Struct-literal consumers must include new fields or use builders;
  exhaustive enum matches may need updating. Existing MCP required inputs remain
  compatible, and the tool catalog remains at 20 tools.
- Keep measured fixture gains and source/binary provenance in
  `docs/workflow-improvement-evidence.json`; historical measurements are not claims
  of universal speedups or measurements of the release binary.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- npm wrapper `@agz-yazilim/agz-rust-mcp`, which resolves, verifies, and caches
  the matching release binary instead of building from source.
- crates.io distribution under the renamed `agz-rust-mcp` package.

### Changed

- Renamed the product identity to `agz-rust-mcp`: the crate, library,
  executable, MCP server name, and `AGZ_RUST_MCP_*` configuration use the new
  name, the MCP Registry package is
  `io.github.ugur-murat-alt/agz-rust-mcp`, and release tags use the
  `agz-rust-mcp-v*` scheme.
- Published release assets under `agz-rust-mcp-<platform>` names; releases up
  to and including 0.2.0 remain published as legacy `agz-rust-coder-*` assets,
  which `install.sh` still maps automatically.
- Removed residual internal resources and identity references that still used
  the former product name.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Bounded streaming Cargo diagnostics, explicit omission/telemetry fields and
  provisional progress; early compiler evidence is never a completed pass.
- Typed feature, target and test-filter options, scoped development validation,
  and opt-in source context with exact resolved dependency versions.
- Opt-in version-checked Nextest and supervised Unix-local Sccache, with
  separate doctests, no silent fallback and real integration coverage.
- Property-based and Loom regression tests, a read-only identity measurement
  harness, and strict same-input benchmark comparison tooling.

### Fixed

- Avoided quadratic workspace file re-counting without changing content
  identities, file budgets or authorized-root boundaries.
- Preserved pre-spawn cancellation and timeout outcomes through Git, metadata
  and analyzer probes; prevented lost process/job/LSP completion wakeups.
- Bounded post-kill cleanup and compiler suggestion source reads; preserved
  Unicode scalar coordinates rather than treating columns as byte offsets.
- Rechecked failed-compilation edit/context freshness and cleared edits after
  cancelled, timed-out or unclean execution.
- Corrected aggregate diagnostic timing, completed-stage counts, failed-test
  tails, zero-test matches and workspace doctest selection.
- Prevented metadata compiler-information probes from starting an unmanaged
  sccache daemon before an explicitly requested supervised cache session.
- Corrected Windows drive-prefix checks and job-completion polling, preserved
  live host leases on macOS/Windows, and fixed canonical-path/timing fixtures.
- Installed smoke binaries outside authorized source roots without weakening
  the root-bound executable check.

### Changed

- Required the existing Linux/macOS/Windows CI, optional-acceleration tests and
  dependency policy before release publication, in addition to artifact checks.
- Advanced to 0.2.0 because public Rust request/evidence structs gain fields.
  Library consumers using struct literals must supply the new fields or use
  constructors/builders such as `GateRequest::new(...).with_options(...)`.
  The 12 MCP tools, prior required inputs and default Cargo behavior remain
  compatible. `all` validates the recorded configuration, not every possible
  feature combination or platform. Supervised Sccache remains Unix-only.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-04

### Security

- Bound authorized Cargo, Git, documentation, and Rust Analyzer subprocesses to
  the exact directory capabilities captured during workspace selection, with
  process-tree cleanup for cancelled schema probes.

### Fixed

- Made metadata ownership, followers, Cargo execution, cancellation, and
  deadlines bounded without publishing late or request-local results to the
  shared cache.
- Made crates.io lookup cancellation-aware while preserving bounded response
  streaming, fixed-host redirects, and immediate admission-permit release.
- Kept Git identity probes within the check request's deadline and cancellation
  lifecycle, with bounded raw output and supervised process-tree cleanup.
- Honored the earlier of the per-process timeout and the request deadline.
- Moved post-validation identity work off the async executor and avoided extra
  Git probes after failed or cancelled Cargo runs.
- Preserved result status and trust markers at the minimum output budget and
  removed complete terminal escape sequences from structured tool results.
- Fixed Linux installation in paths containing spaces, rejected failed archive
  listings, and stopped interrupted installs without replacing the old binary.

### Changed

- Updated the SHA-pinned checkout, upload-artifact, and download-artifact
  actions to 7.0.1, 7.0.1, and 8.0.1 respectively, retaining explicit artifact
  checksum verification and disabled credential persistence.
- Updated reqwest to 0.13.4, TOML to 1.1, and process-wrap to 10.0.0.
- Kept cargo-platform pinned to 0.3.2 to preserve Rust 1.88 support;
  the proposed 0.3.3 upgrade requires Rust 1.91 and was reverted.
- Kept SHA-2 at 0.10.9 after release compilation exposed an incompatible
  hexadecimal formatting API in 0.11.0. The upgrade was reverted together with
  its lockfile dependencies; existing SHA-256 identities remain unchanged.
- Added explicit `release/<Cargo version>` branch publication alongside manual
  workflow dispatch. The branch must match the package version. Publication
  still requires all existing validation jobs and the `release` environment;
  releases are serialized across the repository.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Initial public Rust release with 12 bounded MCP tools for Cargo validation,
  static auditing, crate verification, exact-version documentation, semantic
  navigation, and write-free edit packages.
- MCP protocol support for `2025-11-25` and `2026-07-28`, including client
  roots, tasks, progress, and cancellation.
- Cross-platform child-process supervision, bounded caches and telemetry, and
  provider-free protocol, OpenCode, and benchmark smoke suites.
- Cargo distribution through crates.io and discovery metadata for the official
  MCP Registry.
